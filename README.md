Iâ€™m a developer passionate about building accessible and high-quality user interfaces with modern web technologies.

My expertise lies in translating UI/UX designs into functional, impactful improvements. I specialize in:
- **Next.js/React.js** for dynamic, scalable front-end development
- **TypeScript** for robust, maintainable code
- **Prisma/Drizzle ORM** for efficient and type-safe database interactions
- **TailwindCSS** and UI libraries like **Shadcn** and **MaterialUI** for rapid, consistent interface design

As a Linux enthusiast, I leverage tools like **zsh**, **hyprland** and **tmux** to optimize my workflow. I prioritize system design and logical structure before coding, ensuring performance and maintainability.

Outside of development, I enjoy orchestra, chess, and stargazing.
